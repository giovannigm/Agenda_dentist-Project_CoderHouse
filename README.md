## add persons

When the person selects the day and time, the system looks for what day of the week that date is and if it falls within the working day and time, it is programmed correctly. 


#### A clear example is as in the image the person selects (11/12/2023) the system looks for what day of the week it is and gets (Monday) and the dentist attends (Monday and Tuesday) then it is correct, then checks if the time is within the working hours.
